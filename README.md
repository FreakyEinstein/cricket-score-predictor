# Dataset

## First inning ball to ball coverage of:
* 1474 T-20 matches -> data/t20.csv

## dataset consists of the following columns:

* mid -> Each match is given a unique number
* date -> When the match happened
* venue -> Stadium where match is being played
* bat_team -> Batting team name
* bowl_team -> Bowling team name
* batsman -> Batsman name who faced that ball
* bowler -> Bowler who bowled that ball
* runs -> Total runs scored by team at that instance
* wickets -> Total wickets fallen at that instance
* overs -> Total overs bowled at that instance
* runs_last_5 -> Total runs scored in last 5 overs
* wickets_last_5 -> Total wickets that fell in last 5 overs
* striker -> max(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)
* non-striker -> min(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)
* total -> Total runs scored by batting team after first innings

# Prediction Algorithm and Accuracy

## Algorithms Used

1. Linear Regression -> linear_regression.py
2. Random Forest Regression -> random_forest_regression.py

## Features and Label Used

* Features: [runs,wickets,overs,striker,non-striker]
* Label: [total]

## Accuracy in terms of [R Square Value,Custom Accuracy]

1. Linear Regression
   * T-20 matches -> [52,44]
2. Random Forest Regression
   * T-20 matches -> [64,59]

**Note:**
Custom Accuracy is defined on the basis of difference between the predicted score and actual score. If this difference falls below a particular thresold, we count it as a correct prediction.

* T-20 thresold: 10
